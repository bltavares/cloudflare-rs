# Rust CloudFlare "Do" API

This is a library to make use of the CloudFlare's DO API, the same one used by go-cloudflare.

There is a newer API available on CloudFlare's docuentation, but the resource id's are different between API versions, and I was interested to be compatible with the ids that go-cloudflare reports back.
